Yea...this software isn't even alpha yet. It barely works as is. I
promise to fill this with releavent information once UDJ is in some sort of
a working state.

UDJ Algorithm:
UDJ is a collaborative playlist generator. Let's say we're at a party and the host
has his or her computer hooked up to their sound system. UDJ allows the host to
share his or her library and let other clients (be they mobile or web based) add
music from the library to the current playlist. Users can then "vote"
on items in the playlist. If they vote it up, the song will be moved up in the queue
and if they vote it down, the song will be moved down in the queue. All communication
is done using a REST api. A webserver sits in the middle between all clients and the 
party host. It coordinates all requests for playlist additions, votes, and anything else
that might need to be done for the "party". The webserver can also inject content (be it music,
advertisements, or anything else) into the playlist.
