To run this server for testing/debug purposes do the following:

1. First run the resetDebugDB script.

2. To actually start the server up, run the debugRunServer script. The server
will then be up and you can make http requests to it. To make sure it's running correctly,
you can direct your webbrowser to http://localhost:4897/admin/ and the admin interface 
should pop up. The default credentials are
username: admin
password: udj
