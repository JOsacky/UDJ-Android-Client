Requirements:
Python 2.5 or greater
Django 1.3 (it may work on lesser versions, I haven't tried)

To run this server for testing/debug purposes do the following:

1. First run the resetDebugDB script. This will create two files: udjdb.py and udjDebug.db.
Make sure to add these files to your .gitignore. They should never be commited.

2. To actually start the server up, run the debugRunServer script. The server
will then be up and you can make http requests to it. To make sure it's running correctly,
you can direct your webbrowser to http://localhost:4897/admin/ and the admin interface 
should pop up. The default credentials are
username: admin
password: udj

Note that when running the debug server you won't be using SSL. If you wanna test out SSL you 
need to use the runserver.py script. This will more closely simulate a production environment
server but requires additional configuration on your part. I will document this additional
configuration later.
