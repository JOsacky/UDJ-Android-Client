To run this server for testing/debug purposes do the following.

1. run the resetDebugDB script. If/when it asks you if you want to create a 
super user, just say no. This creates the database that UDJ needs. You only
need to do this once.

2. To actually start the server up, run the debugRunServer script. The server
will then be up and you can make http requests to it.
