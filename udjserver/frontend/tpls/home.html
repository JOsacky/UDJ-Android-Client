          <h1>What is UDJ?</h1>
          <p>UDJ is a social music player. It allows you and your friends to collaboratively
          select which music is playing, in real time. Whether you're at a party, in a bar or restaurant,
          or just hanging out, UDJ is the perfect way for everyone to participate in the music selection.</p>
          <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
          <p>Let's say you're hosting an event this weekend and you want all of your guests to
          be able to help you pick the music that is going to be playing. Well, simply fire up the
          UDJ music player. Guests will then be able to view your playlist from the their
          smartphones. They can also search your music library from their phones and add songs
          to the playlist.  If they see a song added by someone else that they like, they can
          choose to vote it up. The song will then move up in the queue and be played sooner.
          Alternatively, if they see a song they don't like they can vote it down and it will
          move down in the queue.
          </p>
          <p>UDJ works anywhere you have a gathering of people and music is playing:
          Bars, restaurants, parties, weddings, out-door events, and more. Just download the 
          UDJ player (currently in private beta) and get the app for your smartphone!
