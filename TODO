HOST CLIENT
-Enable seemless playback by queuing up songs that are about to be played.
And what's more, songs should fade into one another. Like a real dj would.
Sync the beat of the new song to the beat of the the one that is currently
playing, fade into new song, then gradual return beat of new song to normal.
-Handle the unable to connect signal in host client
-Emit signal from UDJServerConnection is conneciotn is lost or something...
-Import iTunes library capability
-Handle song not being added to the server correctly.

ANDROID APP
-IMPORTANT: SWITCH TO HttpsURLConnection. This will give us automatic caching
compression. Also security. Also, this is what the android team is throwing
themselves behind so it will be getting the most attention.
-Users should be able to remove songs they added form the playlist
(You know, say they accidentally double added a song)
-Indicator on playlist of songs you've added
-Parties without passwords
-Get nearby parties
-Be able to refresh near by parties
-Handle responses from server indicating that the party is over.
-Ditch the tab layout for tablets. We can display both the playlist and the
library in that case.
-Switch all the dialogs to fragments and stop using the 
depercated onCreateDialogs and what not.
-We don't need to send a whole PlaylistEntry every time we're adding one, just
the server_lib_id and the client_playlist_id, the rest should be derivable by
ther server.
-Grey out playlist items that haven't been succesfully added to the server yet.
-Once library search results have been obtained, we should save them if the
activity get's paused, that way when it's resumed we can just load 'em right
back up again without having to requery the server!!!!!! I'm so smart....
-Improve the LibrarySearchLoader to cache results for searches. The AsyncTaskLoader documentation has an example of this.

SERVER
-If two users add the same song within a certain threshold of oneanother (e.g.
the same song was added by two different users within 10 seconds of one another)
just merge the song requests
-If requests are made for a party that is over, notify client
-Test exception cases. 
-Test for commands that are being issued to a party that is over.
-Test events with passwords


OVERALL
-Rdio and Spotify integration!!!!!!
-Client spec list (minimum fucntionality for each client, along with optional 
functionality).
