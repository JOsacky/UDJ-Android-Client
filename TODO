HOST CLIENT
-Enable seemless playback by queuing up songs that are about to be played.
And what's more, songs should fade into one another. Like a real dj would.
Sync the beat of the new song to the beat of the the one that is currently
playing, fade into new song, then gradual return beat of new song to normal.
-Handle the unable to connect signal in host client
-Emit signal from UDJServerConnection is conneciotn is lost or something...

ANDROID APP
-Compress all data before sending it to the phone and then uncompress it.
-Users should be able to remove songs they added form the playlist
(You know, say they accidentally double added a song)
-Indicator on playlist of songs you've added
-Parties without passwords
-Get nearby parties
-Be able to refresh near by parties
-Handle responses from server indicating that the party is over.
-Ditch the tab layout for tablets. We can display both the playlist and the
library in that case.
-Switch all the dialogs to fragments and stop using the 
depercated onCreateDialogs and what not.
-We don't need to send a whole PlaylistEntry every time we're adding one, just
the server_lib_id and the client_playlist_id, the rest should be derivable by
ther server.
-Grey out playlist items that haven't been succesfully added to the server yet.

SERVER
-If two users add the same song within a certain threshold of oneanother (e.g.
the same song was added by two different users within 10 seconds of one another)
just merge the song requests
-If requests are made for a party that is over, notify client
-Once a party ends, a library can then be purged of all songs that have been deleted
-Transmitting the IS_DELETED_PARAM every time could be expensive.
It probably won't be changing that often so perhaps we should only transmit this
if there's been a deletion. Othewise don't transmit it.
-Make an admin URL so that I can do adminish stuff, like drop tables and what
not.
-Fix the post for adding a library song to a PUT.
-If a song is requested to be added to the playlist and has the same host_client_id and adder_id it should be discarded as a duplicate


OVERALL
-Rdio and Spotify integration!!!!!!
